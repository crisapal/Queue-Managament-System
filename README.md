# Queue-Managament-System
This app is learning how to use threads in Java for a parallel access to different type of data.

In order to be able to test it on your own, you should download and execute the JAR file from the terminal, passing the testing input files as arguments, one by one. 

The main of the project is to equally distribute different customers in a queue for avoiding traffic congestion, and that not only in retail, but also in computer networks or different services.

The structure of an input file consists of: 
1. Number of available queues
2. Time of opening the queue
3. Arrival Time
4. Time taken to end his task
